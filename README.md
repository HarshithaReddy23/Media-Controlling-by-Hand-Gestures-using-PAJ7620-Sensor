# Media-Controlling-by-Hand-Gestures-using-PAJ7620-Sensor

1.1 Background (System Study Details in brief)
The system with more comfort factor that includes the operation of media control
without having a hardware involved which helps visually impaired to use it more
flexible. The system has options like play, pause, volume increase/decrease,
forward, rewind, next. PAJ7620 sensor employs an in built proximity sensor which
can sense approaching and departing objects. It detects movements of our hand
gesture (palm) and the code in Arduino and console will detect an operation and
trigger. This sensor detects 9 different types of gestures.

1.2 Problem Statement
This is a gesture-based media controller that can be connected to any computer
running any OS. We can connect it to PCs USB port and it will act as a HID or a
Human Interface Device. Instead of using traditional hand glove-based gesture
systems we are using simple accessible sensors to capture the gestures of hand 
alone for controlling the media experience. By taking control over the function just
by our gestures instead of using keys, mouse, remote.

1.3 Importance
To make users control the media without any hassle activities involving remote,
keys, mouse. To provide as a cost effective product for all type of devices
involving media control.

1.4 Literature Summary
By studying various papers, we have come to known that many sensors are used
like gyro sensor, ultra-sonic sensors, 3D Flex sensor, FMCW radar sensor, Low
resolution Infrared sensor, Accelerometer sensor. Some sensors measures EMG
and FMG to captures the gestures. Some used a time-delay neural network[TDNN]
to recognize gestures based on the extracted trajectories. various mechanisms that
analysisâ€™s hand motions such as SVM, NN, HMM,GMMe used. The contact based
controlling such as Hand data glove, Attached force sensor, Surface
electromyography, Optical markers are used
