By learning the different types of keystrokes from HID library of Nicohood, we were able to control the media and video. Even in the video controller module, we can change the following keystrokes “MEDIA_FAST_FORWARD and “MEDIA_REWIND” into “MEDIA_NEXT” and “MEDIA_PREVIOUS” of
“GES_RIGHT_FLAG” and “GES_LEFT_FLAG” gestures respectively to control
the video playlist itself. For example, Controlling a playlist in YouTube. The code
which we implemented under video can alter the speed, by making the said change
above, we can control the playlist of videos too. So we can change the keystrokes
to the particular gestures on our wish. So the library plays an important part in the
project.




Conclusion and Future Developments

This media controller would be useful instead of the traditional controlling. Pasting
the breadboard with a standing components like above the speaker or any
cardboard would give one to make rich recognizing gestures for controlling.
Future Development: PAJ7620 works for only short range. We can use that to
control media in laptop or PC, but we cannot use this short range sensor for TV,
which is at a great distance. So for controlling media in TV, a gesture recognizing
sensor which can capture at great distance must be used and the keystrokes must be
checked and learned for each and different devices
